This repository houses the documentation, development roadmap, and resources for the p10node website, designed to support blockchain infrastructure services and streamline client onboarding and partnerships.

> **Note**: This repository is an initial proposal and has not yet received any feedback or endorsement from the p10 team. Additionally, the repository is maintained with advisory input from an external collaborator, who is not affiliated with the p10 team. All suggestions and contributions are provided independently to support the development of p10node's website and services.

## Project Overview

The p10node website operates with two core focuses:

1. **Marketing and Business Development**: This area of the site is dedicated to attracting new clients, partners, and stakeholders. It includes resources for client onboarding, partnership information, pricing models, and marketing assets.

2. **Service Delivery**: This section is focused on delivering and supporting blockchain infrastructure services, including Node-as-a-Service (NaaS), RPC services, validator operations, and other Cosmos ecosystem integrations.

## Key Sections of the Website

### Marketing and Business Development

- **Stake with Us**: Information for potential stakers looking to delegate tokens and earn rewards through p10node’s validators.
- **Chain Services**: Detailed descriptions of the Cosmos and blockchain services offered, with a focus on NaaS, RPCs, and validation services.
- **Onboarding**: Resources for new clients and partners, including tutorials and documentation.
- **CosScan**: p10node’s blockchain explorer, designed specifically for Cosmos networks, offering transaction tracking, validator monitoring, and IBC functionality.
- **Pricing Models**: An overview of pricing plans, including validator services, public RPCs, and custom whitelabel validator solutions.

### Service Delivery and Infrastructure

- **Node Running**: Continuous operation and monitoring of nodes to ensure uptime and reliability.
- **Validator**: A customizable validator service that supports transaction validation and network security.
- **Public RPCs**: Publicly accessible RPC endpoints for seamless blockchain interaction.
- **Whitelabel Validator Service**: Branded validator services for enterprise clients.
- **Data Indexers and APIs**: APIs for blockchain data access, supporting analytics and decentralized applications.
- **Additional Features**:
  - **Statesync**: Quick node setup with state synchronization.
  - **Addbook and Livepeers**: Tools for robust network connectivity and node discovery.
  - **Snapshots**: Ready-to-use blockchain snapshots for fast node setup.

### Future Roadmap

- **No-Code Node Creation (P10node SDK)**: Planned development of an SDK that will allow users to deploy nodes without any coding knowledge. This feature will enable broader adoption by allowing non-technical users to participate in node operation and management.
