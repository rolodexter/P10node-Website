# Client Intake and Pre-Qualification

The **Client Intake and Pre-Qualification** process is designed to streamline the engagement between prospective clients and p10node. By simplifying access and leveraging a collaborative space, this process ensures a seamless entry into the p10 system while gathering necessary project details in a dynamic, modular fashion.

## Objectives

- **Simplify client entry**: Enable quick access to the system with minimal barriers to entry.
- **Dynamic engagement**: Use a collaborative space managed by **[p10 administrators](../service_delivery/administrators.md)** to gather project details as needed.
- **Data-driven insights**: Use collected data to refine p10’s understanding of market demands and craft tailored **[terms of engagement](../marketing_business_dev/terms_of_engagement.md)**.
- **Flexibility and control**: Allow p10 administrators to dynamically deploy prefabricated **[survey modules](../marketing_business_dev/survey_modules.md)** and manage client interactions.

## Simplified Workflow

### 1. **[Wallet Registration and Login](../marketing_business_dev/wallet_registration.md)**
   - Clients register and log in using their blockchain wallet (e.g., **[MetaMask](../service_delivery/metamask.md)**, **[Keplr](../service_delivery/keplr.md)**).
   - This approach ensures:
      - **Minimal friction** for access.
      - **Authentication and identity verification** based on wallet credentials.
   - Once logged in, clients gain immediate access to the collaborative **[pre-qualification space](../marketing_business_dev/prequalification_space.md)**.

### 2. **[Collaborative Space](../marketing_business_dev/collaborative_space.md)**
   - The collaborative space is a dynamic environment where clients and p10 operators can refine project details and requirements.
   - **Features**:
      - **[Modular Surveys](../marketing_business_dev/survey_modules.md)**: Prefabricated survey modules can be deployed by p10 administrators to gather specific data points.
      - **Real-Time Interaction**: Clients can respond to questions, upload documents, and provide feedback directly within the space.
      - **[Project Notes](../marketing_business_dev/project_notes.md)**: Both parties can collaborate on project goals, requirements, and key deliverables.
   - **Administrative Management**:
      - p10 administrators or operators manage the collaborative space, ensuring questions and modules are relevant to the client’s needs.
      - Operators can:
         - Add/remove modules dynamically.
         - Monitor client responses and engagement.

### 3. **[Data Collection and Analysis](../marketing_business_dev/data_analysis.md)**
   - The collaborative space collects responses and notes, which are stored in a structured format.
   - **Key data points include**:
      - **[Project goals](../marketing_business_dev/project_goals.md)** and requirements.
      - **[Preferred blockchain network](../service_delivery/blockchain_networks.md)** and environment (Testnet/Mainnet).
      - Service needs (e.g., **[RPC services](../service_delivery/public_rpcs.md)**, **[NaaS](../service_delivery/naas_services.md)**, **[validator operations](../service_delivery/validator.md)**).
      - Timelines and milestones.
   - This data is used to:
      - Draft preliminary **[terms of engagement](../marketing_business_dev/terms_of_engagement.md)** automatically.
      - Provide actionable insights into the global **[RPC/NaaS market](../marketing_business_dev/rpc_naas_market.md)**.

### 4. **[Drafting Terms of Engagement](../marketing_business_dev/terms_of_engagement.md)**
   - Using the data collected, p10 automatically generates a draft **Terms of Engagement** document.
   - This draft is reviewed by the p10 team and adjusted if needed before being shared with the client for approval.

## Benefits of the Simplified Workflow

- **[Ease of Access](../marketing_business_dev/ease_of_access.md)**: Wallet-based login eliminates the need for complex registrations or forms, ensuring clients can get started quickly.
- **[Dynamic and Modular](../marketing_business_dev/survey_modules.md)**: Prefabricated survey modules allow for tailored interactions, reducing unnecessary questions while focusing on relevant details.
- **[Scalable](../marketing_business_dev/scalability.md)**: The workflow can handle multiple client engagements simultaneously, thanks to administrative oversight and automated processes.
- **[Collaborative](../marketing_business_dev/collaborative_space.md)**: The shared space fosters real-time collaboration, ensuring clear communication and alignment of goals.

## Future Enhancements

- **[AI-Driven Module Suggestions](../marketing_business_dev/ai_module_suggestions.md)**:
   - Use AI to recommend prefabricated modules based on client responses and past engagements.
   - Suggest questions to fill potential data gaps.
- **[Blockchain-Based Agreements](../marketing_business_dev/blockchain_agreements.md)**:
   - Finalized terms of engagement could be secured on-chain for transparency and immutability.
- **[Enhanced Metrics](../marketing_business_dev/metrics.md)**:
   - Provide operators with analytics on client interactions within the collaborative space, enabling better engagement strategies.
