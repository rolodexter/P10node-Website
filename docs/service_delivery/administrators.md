# Administrators in the p10node System

The **Administrators** in the p10node system play a critical role in managing client engagements, ensuring smooth operations, and maintaining the collaborative spaces used during the **Client Intake and Pre-Qualification** process. Their responsibilities extend across multiple operational areas, contributing to the seamless delivery of p10node services.

## Role and Responsibilities

### 1. **Managing Collaborative Spaces**
   - Administrators oversee the **[pre-qualification collaborative space](../marketing_business_dev/collaborative_space.md)** where clients and p10 interact.
   - Responsibilities include:
      - Adding or removing **[survey modules](../marketing_business_dev/survey_modules.md)** dynamically based on client needs.
      - Monitoring client interactions and ensuring all relevant data is collected.
      - Maintaining clear and organized notes within the space to inform terms of engagement.

### 2. **Ensuring Data Integrity**
   - Administrators validate the data provided by clients, ensuring accuracy and completeness.
   - This data is critical for:
      - Drafting **[Terms of Engagement](../marketing_business_dev/terms_of_engagement.md)**.
      - Informing internal strategies and insights into the global RPC/NaaS economy.

### 3. **Facilitating Real-Time Communication**

   - Examples include modules for:
      - Project requirements
      - Preferred blockchain networks
      - Node and infrastructure needs
